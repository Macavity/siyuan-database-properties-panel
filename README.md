# Database Properties Panel Plugin

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ](./README.zh_CN.md)
[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Overview

The SiYuan Database Properties Panel plugin enhances your SiYuan experience by enabling a feature commonly found in similar tools.
It's heavily inspired by the now archived and no longer maintained [SiYuan-Attributes-Panel](https://github.com/TransMux/SiYuan-Attributes-Panel/).
This plugin allows users to view database row attributes directly on the dedicated pages created from those rows.
